# CODSOFT
My virtual internship experience with CodSoft Company in Java programming has been nothing short of enlightening and incredibly valuable for enhancing my programming skills. Throughout the internship, I was engaged in three distinct tasks that collectively contributed to my proficiency in Java programming.

For the first task, I worked on a captivating Number Game project. This task involved designing an interactive game where players guessed a randomly generated number within a specified range. Implementing various programming concepts, such as user input validation and random number generation, allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java fundamentals while creating an engaging user experience.

The second task, the Student Grade Calculator, truly challenged my problem-solving abilities. I developed a program that efficiently calculated and displayed student grades based on input scores. This project delved into conditional statements, loops, and data manipulation, refining my logical thinking and programming prowess.

The third task proved to be equally enriching. I was tasked with designing an ATM interface, simulating real-world ATM interactions. Creating a user-friendly interface while managing account balances and transaction flows gave me hands-on experience in object-oriented programming.

Overall, my virtual internship with CodSoft equipped me with practical skills beyond theoretical knowledge. Through the completion of these three tasks, I gained an in-depth understanding of Java's intricacies and applications. The guidance provided by the experienced professionals at CodSoft and the complexity of the tasks presented during the internship have significantly bolstered my programming acumen and problem-solving skills. This experience has undeniably paved the way for my growth as a proficient Java programmer, positioning me for success in future programming endeavors.
